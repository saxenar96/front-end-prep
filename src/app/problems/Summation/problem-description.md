# Summation

## Description

In this problem, you will displaying the sum of a list of elements.

The user will have an option to enter a number in a text field. When they click `ENTER`, you must display the item in the list under the input. When a new item is added to the list, the sum value should be updated to reflect that value.

Each item in the list also has a button to delete it. After deleting an item, that value should be subtracted from the total sum.

## Style Requirements
- Each item in the list should have a border around it with a padding of `4px` and delete button (indicated by an X), to the right side.
- The items should be rendered in vertical columns. Each column may consist of `5` items. After `5`, render the next item in a new column.
- The value text should be centered, have a font size of `24px`, and be bolded.
